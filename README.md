### Welcome

Below are collections of code I've published to allow me to use at companies I've worked with/for without loosing my intellectual property.

I've been a professional computer programmer since the late '70s.
I read about UNIX and the C programming language and looked for a way to use them.
After purchasing a micro computer in the early '80s that included them, I was hooked.
And, now, so is most of the computing world.

C is: mature, stable and ubiquitous.
Often described as a portable assembly language,
C translates directly to processor instructions and is: fast, small and efficient.
Why program a computer in any other language?
Is C too close to the processor?

You will find a couple of repositories that take full advantage of the closeness (the callback parsers).
They have no dependences (not even on the standard C library).
They are pure C functions that get down and dirty to rip through XML and JSON.

There is a repository that significantly simplifies multi-thread programming in C.
Exploiting POSIX threads, channels enable a style of programming that is common in newer programming languages.
And uncommon features, like lazy evaluation.

And, as C operations map to instructions, C structures organize memory for efficient access.
Processing rich information is possible but tedious, at best.
There is a much better language for handling data.
The [SQLite](https://sqlite.org) library is an indispensable tool for the C programmer.
Declarative programming for data rich C!
A couple more repositories marry the XML and JSON callback parsers with SQLite to provide DOM capabilities.

Lastly, C is an imperative language.
Implementing dynamic execution is possible but tedious, at best.
There is a much better language for handling dynamic execution.
The [CLIPS](https://clipsrules.net) library is another indispensable tool for the C programmer.
Declarative programming for dynamic C!
There is a repository that marries data rich SQLite with dynamic CLIPS.

Enjoy!
